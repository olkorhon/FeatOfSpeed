This project was done for the Mobile & Social Computing course in the Spring of 2017.

Feat of Speed (working title) is a location based fitness/social game.

Players are given a set of waypoints (using the Google Places API) from their vicinity, and their goal is to visit all of them as fast as possible. The game uses Geofences to sense when the player is near a waypoint.

Everytime a new game is created, the waypoints are different. 
The game uses Firebase as it's backend (https://github.com/olkorhon/FeatOfSpeedBackend).
